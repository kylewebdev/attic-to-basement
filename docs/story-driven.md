## Page 1: Homepage - The Scroll Story

This is the centerpiece. A single long-scroll narrative that takes visitors from emotional tension to resolution. Every scroll section maps to a GSAP animation beat.

The story arc: **Overwhelm >> Someone understands >> Here is how they help >> Proof it works >> Take the first step**

---

### SECTION 1 - THE HOOK
**Scroll position:** 0-10%
**Animation:** Text fades in over a slow-zoom background. Minimal, quiet, space to breathe.

**Headline:**
> A lifetime of memories. One decision to make.

**Subtext:**
> Whether you are downsizing, settling an estate, or simply ready for a fresh start, the weight of sorting through a home full of belongings can feel impossible. You do not have to carry it alone.

**Design notes:**
Muted, warm palette. Maybe a softly lit interior or a still life of personal objects (vintage clock, framed photo, well-worn book). Nothing stock-photo sterile. This should feel human.

**CTA (soft):** Down-arrow scroll indicator, no button yet. Let the story pull them in.

---

### SECTION 2 - THE TENSION
**Scroll position:** 10-25%
**Animation:** Elements stagger in one by one as the user scrolls, building a sense of accumulation and overwhelm. Could use a parallax stack effect where items visually pile up.

**Headline:**
> Every room tells a story. Every drawer holds a decision.

**Content beats (revealed on scroll, one at a time):**

1. "What is worth selling? What should be donated? What do you keep?"
2. "How do you price a lifetime of collected things fairly?"
3. "Who handles the marketing, the staging, the buyers, the cleanup?"
4. "And how do you do all of this while grieving, or while managing a move, or while living 200 miles away?"

**Design notes:**
This section should feel like the emotional reality of the person visiting. Do not solve anything yet. Let the weight sit for a beat. The scroll pacing itself should slow slightly here so these questions land.

---

### SECTION 3 - THE TURN
**Scroll position:** 25-35%
**Animation:** The visual clutter from Section 2 clears away. Screen brightens. A clean, confident entrance. This is the "relief arrives" moment.

**Headline:**
> That is where we come in.

**Subtext:**
> Attic to Basement Estate Liquidators handles everything, from the first walkthrough to the final sweep, so you do not have to figure it out alone.

**Supporting line:**
> Over 20 years of combined experience across Northern California. Hundreds of families served. Led by Cortnee Beggs, who treats every home like it matters, because it does.

**Design notes:**
This is the brand entrance. Logo or wordmark animation. Photo of Cortnee or the team in action (staging, organizing, interacting with a client). Warm, competent, real.

---

### SECTION 4 - THE PROCESS
**Scroll position:** 35-55%
**Animation:** A horizontal or stepped timeline that progresses as the user scrolls vertically. Each step animates into view with an icon or illustration.

**Headline:**
> From attic to basement. Here is how it works.

**Steps (each a scroll beat):**

**Step 1: Free Consultation**
You call or fill out a form. We come to you, walk through the property, and talk through your goals. No cost, no pressure, no obligation.

**Step 2: Planning and Appraisal**
We evaluate everything in the home. Our certified team prices items accurately based on current market value, not guesswork. Together, we build a plan tailored to your timeline and needs.

**Step 3: Organizing and Staging**
We transform the space. Items are sorted, cleaned, displayed, and arranged for maximum buyer appeal. Clients regularly say their homes are unrecognizable (in the best way) after a few days of staging.

**Step 4: Marketing and Promotion**
Your sale gets listed on EstateSales.net, EstateSales.org, and promoted across our channels. Addresses go live at 6 AM on sale day. We bring the buyers to you.

**Step 5: Sale Day Execution**
We run the entire sale: managing foot traffic, answering questions, handling transactions, and keeping everything organized and secure. You can be there or not. We have it covered.

**Step 6: Post-Sale Resolution**
After the sale, we handle remaining items through buyout, cleanout, or coordinated donation to a nonprofit of your choice. You get an itemized list of everything sold. The home is left clean and ready for its next chapter.

**Design notes:**
This section should feel orderly and reassuring after the emotional tension of Sections 1-2. Clean layout, generous spacing. Maybe subtle before/after imagery if you have staging photos. Each step should feel like a weight being lifted.

---

### SECTION 5 - SERVICE AREA
**Scroll position:** 55-62%
**Animation:** A stylized map that fills in regions as you scroll, or pins that drop into place.

**Headline:**
> Serving Northern California, from the Bay to the Foothills

**Content:**
Greater Sacramento Area, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Placer County (Auburn and surrounding areas), El Dorado County (Placerville and surrounding areas), and the Sierra foothill communities in between.

**Subtext:**
> Not sure if you are in our range? Call us. We will figure it out.

**Design notes:**
Keep this visual and fast. The map does the talking. Avoid a boring city list. The map animation should feel like the company reaching out across the region.

---

### SECTION 6 - SOCIAL PROOF
**Scroll position:** 62-78%
**Animation:** Testimonial cards that slide or fade in as the user scrolls. Could use a carousel or a staggered masonry layout that builds as you go.

**Headline:**
> Do not take our word for it.

**Testimonial highlights (curated from Yelp, BBB, EstateSales.org):**

Pull 4-6 of the strongest quotes. Prioritize ones that:
- Mention Cortnee by name (personal trust)
- Describe transformation ("the house was completely organized in two days")
- Reference emotional relief ("made an impossible situation manageable")
- Come from both sellers AND buyers (shows both sides of the experience)

**Stats bar (animated counters):**
- 20+ years combined experience
- 4.5 out of 5 star average rating
- 49+ reviews on Yelp alone
- BBB Accredited

**Design notes:**
This section needs to feel abundant. Not one lonely quote on a big white screen, but a wall of evidence. Real names, real context. Link out to Yelp and BBB for anyone who wants to verify. A "See all reviews" link goes to the /reviews page.

---

### SECTION 7 - THE ASK
**Scroll position:** 78-90%
**Animation:** Everything simplifies. One clear call to action dominates the viewport. Slight zoom or scale-up animation to draw focus.

**Headline:**
> Ready to talk? We are ready to listen.

**Subtext:**
> Schedule your free, no-obligation consultation. We will come to you, walk through your situation, and give you a clear plan. No surprises.

**CTA Button:** "Schedule Your Free Consultation" (links to /contact)

**Secondary CTA:**
> Prefer to call? (916) 521-1077. We are available 24/7.

**Design notes:**
Strip everything else away. No distractions. This is the conversion moment. Keep the background warm but simple. Maybe a soft image of a clean, empty room (the "after" of the story).

---

### SECTION 8 - FOOTER
**Scroll position:** 90-100%
**Animation:** Slides up into view.

**Content:**
- ABE Liquidators logo
- Phone: (916) 521-1077
- Location: Sacramento, CA
- Instagram: @abe.liquidators
- Quick links: Upcoming Sales, Services, About, Reviews, Contact

## Page 3: Our Services

**Purpose:** Detailed service info for clients who are researching and comparing companies.

Need to move faster than a traditional sale allows? We will make a fair offer on the entire contents of a home. Quick, clean, and straightforward.

**Cleanouts**
After a sale, after a buyout, or on their own. We clear out and clean up the property so it is ready for sale, rental, or whatever comes next. Donations are coordinated with the nonprofit of your choice.

**Personal Property Appraisals**
Certified appraisals for household goods, antiques, collectibles, furniture, and more. Whether you need valuations for an estate sale, insurance, or legal purposes, our team delivers accurate, market-informed assessments.

### Layout

**Hero:**
Headline: "The people behind the promise."
Photo of Cortnee Beggs and/or the team.

## Scroll Animation Notes for the Developer

### Homepage Pacing
The homepage story should take roughly 8-12 full scroll lengths (viewport heights) to complete. Suggested section heights:

| Section | VH (approx) | Pacing |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 - Hook | 1.5 VH | Slow. Let it breathe. |
| 2 - Tension | 2.0 VH | Medium. Build accumulation. |
| 3 - The Turn | 1.0 VH | Quick snap. Relief moment. |
| 4 - Process | 3.0 VH | Steady scroll. Six steps. |
| 5 - Service Area | 1.0 VH | Fast. Visual does the work. |
| 6 - Social Proof | 2.0 VH | Medium. Let quotes land. |
| 7 - The Ask | 1.0 VH | Slow. Conversion focus. |
| 8 - Footer | 0.5 VH | Standard. |

### Animation Principles
- Favor fade and slide over bounce and spin. This is a serious, emotional service. Keep the motion elegant.
- Parallax depth should be subtle. Do not make visitors feel like they are on a roller coaster.
- Scroll-triggered reveals should feel like turning pages, not like a PowerPoint deck.
- Prioritize readability. If an animation makes text harder to read, cut it.
- Mobile: Simplify or flatten animations. Scroll-jacking on mobile is frustrating. Let native scroll behavior do most of the work and trigger reveals on intersection instead.

### Performance
- Lazy-load images below the fold.
- Keep the total page weight under 3 MB if possible.
- GSAP ScrollTrigger with `scrub: true` for smooth scroll-linked animations.
- Use `will-change: transform, opacity` on animated elements for GPU acceleration.

## Content Gaps to Fill Before Build

These are things the storyboard calls for that may not exist yet:

1. **Cortnee's personal story / origin paragraph** for the About page. Needs to come from her or be written collaboratively.
2. **High-quality staging photos** showing before/after or the team in action. These are critical for the homepage story and Upcoming Sales page.
3. **Curated testimonial selection** from Yelp, BBB, and EstateSales.org. Pick the 8-12 strongest for the homepage and reviews page.
4. **Upcoming sale details** or a plan for how sales will be posted and updated (CMS integration, manual updates, or pulling from EstateSales.net API if available).
5. **Team photo or headshot of Cortnee** for the About page hero.
6. **Service area map graphic** or coordinates for building the animated map in Section 5.
