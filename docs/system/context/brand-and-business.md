# Brand & Business Context

## Brand & Design Guidelines

Full brand guide: `.ai/context/brand.md`. Key points:

- **Tone:** Warm, reassuring, professional. Lead with empathy, follow with competence. Never salesy, corporate, or dismissive of sentimental value.
- **Voice:** First-person plural ("we"). Plain language, no jargon. Confident but not condescending.
- **Visual direction:** Clean, airy, grounded. Warm neutrals (earth tones, muted sage/slate, warm whites). Generous whitespace — the site should feel calming.
- **Typography:** Humanist sans-serif for body, soft serif for headlines. Prioritize readability (audience skews older, often reading under stress).
- **Photography:** Real over stock. Warm natural lighting. Staged estate sales, detail shots, candid team photos. No generic handshake/clipboard stock.
- **Avoid:** Discount/clearance aesthetics (bright reds, neons), overly polished imagery, pressure language ("act now"), clinical terms ("asset disposal").
