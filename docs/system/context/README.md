# Context

Drop files here that you want AI assistants to reference during tasks.

## Examples

- API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger docs)
- Design documents or wireframes
- Architecture diagrams
- Relevant RFCs or technical specs
- Example code from other projects

## Tips

- Keep files focused — one topic per file.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `auth-api-spec.md`, not `notes.md`).
- Remove files when they're no longer relevant.
- AI assistants won't read these automatically — reference them in your prompts.
