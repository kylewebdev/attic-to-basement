---

## 9. Visual Identity (Recommended Direction)

*Note: These are directional recommendations for a redesign, not current brand standards.*

### Color Palette Guidance
- Lean toward warm, grounded tones (deep greens, warm neutrals, soft golds) rather than cold or stark palettes
- Avoid anything that reads as "discount" or "clearance sale" (bright reds, neon yellows)
- The palette should feel trustworthy, calm, and slightly elevated

### Typography Guidance
- Pair a clean serif (for headlines and the brand name) with a readable sans-serif (for body text)
- Avoid overly decorative or trendy typefaces
- Readability matters: the audience skews older and may be reading in stressful circumstances

### Photography and Imagery
- Real photos over stock when possible (staged sales, before/after shots, team at work)
- Warm, natural lighting
- Show the transformation: cluttered rooms becoming beautifully staged sales
- Avoid sterile or overly polished imagery that feels disconnected from the real work

### Logo Usage
- The name "Attic to Basement" is the brand's most distinctive verbal asset; the logo should make this prominent
- "ABE Liquidators" works as a shorthand but should always be clearly tied to the full name
- Ensure legibility at small sizes (social media avatars, mobile headers)

## 10. Digital Presence

### Website (abeliquidators.com)
- Six core pages: Home, Estate Sales, Estate Liquidation, Our Promise, Reviews, Appraisals
- Every page should include a clear path to schedule a free consultation
- Mobile-first design is essential for the audience

### Social Media
- **Instagram (@abe.liquidators):** Primary social channel. Use for sale previews, behind-the-scenes staging, notable finds, client thank-yous, and community engagement.
- Tone should be warmer and more casual than the website, but still professional

### Third-Party Profiles
- **Yelp:** 49 reviews, 393 photos (as of Feb 2026). Maintain active presence and respond to reviews.
- **BBB:** Accredited. Keep listing current.
- **EstateSales.net / EstateSales.org:** Primary sale listing platforms. Addresses posted at 6 AM on sale day.

### Review Themes to Amplify
Based on existing client feedback, the strongest proof points to feature are:
- Seamless, stress-free experience during difficult transitions
- Homes "completely transformed" in days
- Cortnee's personal responsiveness and organization
- Fair pricing for buyers
- Decades-old homes handled with care

---

## 11. Competitive Differentiators

When positioning ABE against competitors, emphasize:

1. **Full end-to-end service** - Consultation through final cleanup and donations. No gaps.
2. **Personal leadership** - Cortnee Beggs is the face of the business and clients interact with her directly.
3. **Breadth of coverage** - Bay Area to the Sierra foothills is a wide net few competitors match.
4. **Proven track record** - 20+ years combined experience, strong review history across multiple platforms.
5. **Compliance and credentials** - Fully insured, bonded, certified, and BBB-accredited.
